    "2. Registration evaluation:\n",
    "   * Registration accuracy, the quantity of interest is the Target Registration Error (TRE).\n",
    "   * TRE is spatially variant.\n",
    "   * Surrogate metrics for evaluating registration accuracy such as segmentation overlaps are relevant, but are potentially deficient.\n",
    "   * Registration time.\n",
